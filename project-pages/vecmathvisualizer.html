      <h1>VecMathVisualizer</h1>
      <p class="description">
        VecMath is a command line math tool that is used during some courses at Digital Arts and Entertainment. It supports vector, matrix, and quaternion math, but is neither terribly intuitive to use nor a visual way to learn.

        During our Graphics Programming course, I therefore took it upon myself to make this tool at least a little more visual. I wrote a Vulkan renderer that supports rendering 3D models with a simple lambertian diffuse.
        <br>
        I then appended commands to the command line application's grammar using ANTLR, allowing the user to display the variables they are doing math with in 3D space. This can render 2D & 3D Vectors, along with Quaternions.
        <br>
        <br>
        This project taught me how to read myself into a sizable, already established project, meaningfully make changes, and attach tools to it.
