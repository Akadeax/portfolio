      <h1>Terrain Color Painter</h1>
      <p class="description">
        This project is an Unreal editor tool that allows for iterating the color of small pieces of terrain very quickly.
        <br>

        <p>This tool was created as a research project; it was meant to determine whether graph coloring algorithms had
        potential for use in a terrain generation pipeline, especially as an alternative for projects where
        extensive Houdini pipelines to deal with terrain were simply too bulky.</p>
        During this project I had to become intimately familiar with how the Unreal editor actually
        functions behind the curtain. I also ended up writing some documentation on the systems I
        touched (for future personal reference), due to Unreal's documentation being lackluster.
