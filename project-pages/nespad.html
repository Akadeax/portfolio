        What is the innovation we actually need?
        <br><br>
        Nespad – the notepad of the past.
        <br><br>
        NESPad is a fully functional notepad for the Nintendo Entertainment System supporting 3 fonts, 4 colors, and much more, taking the NES to it's physical limits.

        This project was made for the course Retro Games and Emulator Programming given by Tom Tesch.<br>
        Whilst in the beginning it was a mess to wrap my head around assembly it quickly turned into a fun puzzle of saving every possible bit to squeeze out as much usable memory as we could.<br>
        <br>Our main focus for this project was squeezing every single last bit of storage space out of the NES' limited cartridges. We ended up using the entire 8 Kilobytes of Working RAM to save text that could persist between sessions, and using all of our zero-page memory very intentionally.
        <br>
        <br>
        Developing for the NES, and especially a project this weird, really helped me gain an incredibly interesting perspective on modern game development and it's techniques.
        <br>
        Just tool-wise, this project taught me so many unique things, from developing NESTest (A unit testing framework), to developing a simple hand-written linter. Generally programming-wise, writing code in this low level of a language also proved incredibly interesting.
