      <h1>The Boy and the Brush</h1>
  <p class="description">
    This game is the result of a game jam with the theme: <i>"It Spreads."</i>
    <br><br>
    When thinking about <i>"it spreads"</i>, we came up with the idea of spreading color into a grayed-out world.
    <br> This, combined with a <i>platformer-style</i> game, became the core concept.
    <br><br>In this project, my role involved handling the shader required for coloring the world along with some gameplay mechanics, art integration, and general bridging between the art and dev team.

    The biggest challenge I overcame in the production of this was the painting in of the background as the player moves around. It was achieved using a render texture; a black-and-white shader is applied to the background image, but only where the render texture is black. The player paints the render texture white as they walk around.
    <br>
    This had to function with a moving camera though, meaning the render texture overlay had to be panned and zoomed, but eventually I got this working, combining some Unreal C++ classes along with some of Unreal's Shadergraph.
