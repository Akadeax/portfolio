      <p class="description">
        NESTest is a unit testing framework for making games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 6502 assembly.
         It allows testing and verifying that the expected values in code stay expected.
        <br><br>
       When running tests, the framework will give your development environment output along these lines:

        <br><br>
        This project started due to a very acute lack of unit testing me and a colleague felt while developing NESPad, a fully-featured NES text editor.<br>
        Especially in a language as complex as 6502 assembly where it is incredibly easy to break old code with newly written code, I felt that not being able to unit test functions was a huge detriment. It had cost us as least 20 combined hours of debugging up to that point in the project.

        <br><br>This warranted spending some of the development time on a unit testing framework.
        <br><br>
        NESTest taught me a lot of things about designing easy-to-use processes and syntax, inter-operation between multiple programs using sockets, and making tools as extensible as possible. For example:
        <ul style="margin-top: -20px; margin-left: 20px">
        <li>running and viewing test results is a one-click operation in the IDE due to a prepared tasks.json file</li>
        <li>tests are automatically ran when making a git commit due to a git hook, preventing the commit if tests fail</li>
        <li>the unit testing runs in an emulator, but I abstracted the logic away so it can work with any emulator</li>
        </ul>
        <br>All of this is to make the tool as flexible as possible while being as close to plug-and-play as it can be.
